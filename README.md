# AndroidApp
CSC 415 Semster Project 
I have chosen to write an android app that imports important dates from your calendar and Facebook such as Birthdays, Anniversaries and Events. The app will notify the user to send a preset text message or email on your behalf on that day directly from the app.  The app will be able to interpret events and pick a preset message for that specific event, for example if Facebook says its someone’s birthday the app will pull that data and understand it is a birthday and automatically choose the preset message pertaining to birthdays. Although the app will choose a preset text or email based on the data it pulls the user will be able to change the default messages sent for events or send custom messages entirely. The app will also allow users to set custom dates independent of your calendar and Facebook so that events that are not on a calendar or Facebook are not excluded. Users should also be able to toggle notifications from the app so that notifications do not duplicate.
